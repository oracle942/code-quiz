# code-quiz

This application was built for a code quiz assignment as part of the UCLA coding bootcamp.

This application is a quiz to test the users understanding of fundamental Javascript concepts. 

Building this application provided a challenging learning experience. As a new developer learning javascript I was challenged to learn and apply many basic and intermediate Javascript concepts.

## Usage

The application provides an instruction screen when loaded. Follow the application link https://oracle942.github.io/code-quiz/

## Credit

This code was written by myself with help of the course insturctor, teacher's assistant, and tutor.


## notes

The attempted display of highscores via local storage functionality failed. The reference to html element 'message' (line 148) fails to display for unknown reasons. Local storage does register in scoreTally. If functional, list-items would then have been appended to a unordered-list of highscores.
