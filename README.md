# code-quiz

This application was built for a code quiz assignment as part of the UCLA coding bootcamp.

This application is a quiz to test the users understanding of fundamental Javascript concepts. 

Building this application provided a challenging learning experience. As a new developer learning javascript I was challenged to learn and apply many basic and intermediate Javascript concepts.

## Usage

The application provides an instruction screen when loaded. Follow the application link https://oracle942.github.io/code-quiz/
